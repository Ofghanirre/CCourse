# C Courses repository

This repo contains mini projects in C to learn the language!

Visit [branches](https://github.com/Ofghanirre/CCourse/branches) to discovers projects to play with or to use =)

Here is an enumeration of the availables projects so far:

| branch | description | 
| --- | --- |
| [ProjectGenericCList](https://github.com/Ofghanirre/CCourse/tree/ProjectGenericCList) | An exercise for students to use pointers and memory smoothly within C. You need to implements a Generic List in C, in other terms, a list that can contains anything without having to code an implementation for each type. Thus coding a list you can reuse for each and every project you have. |
| [ProjectGenericCList_correction](https://github.com/Ofghanirre/CCourse/tree/ProjectGenericCList_correction) | The correction of the ProjectGenericCList project, this is an implementation, not the perfect one, and I encourage students to create their own version |
| [ProjectGenericTreeVisualization](https://github.com/Ofghanirre/CCourse/tree/ProjectGenericTreeVisualization) | A C-coded generic Tree visualizer using dot. This project is for students to use to visualize their trees while working algorithm. It can also learn with generic programmation in C and comes with a detailed generic makefile that student can use as an inspiration. |
